        <p> THE PROBLEM</p>

        <h4>Senior immigrant Chinese citizens face difficulties finding a community with similar interests and cultures
            around them and have troubles using event finder apps due to language barriers, cultural
            differences, and accessibility issues associated with
            attending events listed on the app. These factors may limit their ability to access and participate in
            events.</h4>

        <div class="sectionSeperator"></div>

        <div class="grid-container-2">

                <h2> Incorporate a theme that the target user group will be familiar with</h2>

                    <li> First impressions are extremely important</li>
                    <li> The interface is inspired by traditional non-digital interfaces that many Chinese immigrants
                        will
                        be familiar with</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Event finder apps may be primarily designed and marketed in English, making it difficult

        <p> CONCLUSIONS</p>

        <div class="grid-container-1">
            <p>Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that highlighted the importance of designing
                for accessibility and user-centred design. By prioritizing the needs and preferences of the target
                demographic, I was able to create an effective and user-friendly application that promotes social
                engagement and inclusion for immigrant seniors.
            </p>
            <h3> What I've Learned</h3>
            <h4> Don't fully invest into an idea just yet, iterate, iterate, iterate </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> During the ideation phase, we made the mistake of investing too much time in a solution that didn't
                    fully meet user needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4> Use Data! Its part of the process for a reason.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> We often met crossroads when making design decisions and by going back to the data helped us to
                    back up our decisions.</li>
            </ul>
