        <p> THE PROBLEM</p>

        <h4>Many watch shopping websites often provide insufficient information about the products they sell, which can
            make it difficult for customers to make informed decisions about their purchases.
        </h4>

        <div class="sectionSeperator"></div>

        <p> THE SOLUTION</p>
        <div class="grid-container-2">
            <div>
                <h2> Create a website that uses clean and simple designs, clear navigation, and visual hierarchy to
                    guide users to relevant information.</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> The landing page on the website first introduces the user to 3 popular categories of watches to
                        guide them to make an informed purchase</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Many watch selling websites do not offer personalized recommendations based on a user's browsing
                        or purchase history.</li>
                    <li>Inconsistent or incomplete product information can make it challenging for users to compare
                        products and make informed purchasing decisions.</li>
                    <li>Some watch selling websites may not be transparent about the origin, quality, or authenticity of
                        their products.</li>

                <h3> User Interviews</h3>
                <h5>During the interviews, I would use a semi-structured approach, which would allow me to ask
                    open-ended questions while also ensuring that I cover all of the key topics. The interview questions
                    would focus on understanding user needs, pain points, and preferences related to watch websites.
                    Some sample questions could include:
                </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li> How do you currently shop for watches online?</li>
                    <li> What do you like and dislike about watch websites you have used in the past?</li>
                    <li> How important is personalized recommendations to you when shopping for watches online?</li>
                    <li> How do you typically make a decision about which watch to purchase?</li>
                    <li> What kind of information do you need to feel confident about making a purchase?</li>

                <h3> Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
                <h5>The goal of using heuristic evaluation is to identify pain points and usability issues with existing
                    watch selling websites and to note them down. I took the following steps for conducting this
                    heuristic evaluation.</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li> Identify the heuristics - I would start by identifying a set of heuristics to evaluate the
                        website against.</li>
                    <li> Evaluate the website - Next, I would conduct a thorough evaluation of the website based on the
                        identified heuristics. </li>
                    <li> Prioritize issues - After completing the evaluation, I would prioritize the identified issues
                        based on their severity and impact on the user experience. </li>
                    <li> Create a report - Finally, I would create a report summarizing the evaluation findings,
                        including recommendations for improving the website's usability and design. </li>

                    ensure that users can easily find the information they need, such as product descriptions and
                    pricing. We took the following steps to do so:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li> We needed to access the website's visual design to ensure that it is appealing, engaging, and
                        easy to read, with appropriate use of colors, typography, and imagery.
                    </li>
                    <li> Testing the website's search functionality to ensure that it returns relevant results and is
                        easy to use.</li>
                    <li>Evaluating the website's checkout process to ensure that it is streamlined, efficient, and easy
                        to complete.</li>

                        to complete their purchase and have a positive experience on the website.</li>
                    <li> We wanted to provide users with as much information as possible for them to purchase the

        <p> CONCLUSIONS</p>

        <div class="grid-container-1">
            <p>This project has taught me a very valuable lession about designing UI for a website. I learned that
                simplicity and clarity are critical in website design, especially when it comes to e-commerce. A
                cluttered or confusing website can be overwhelming and make it difficult for users to find what they are
                looking for. By focusing on simplicity and clarity, I was able to create a website that is easy to
                navigate and use.
            </p>
            <h3> What I've Learned</h3>
            <h4> Consistency and branding</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Consistency is important in website design, especially when it comes to branding. I learned that
                    creating a consistent visual language and branding helps to create a sense of trust and credibility
                    with users. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4> Importance of mobile responsiveness</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> With the increasing use of mobile devices, designing a website that is mobile-responsive is
                    critical. I learned that designing for mobile devices requires a different approach, and that
                    ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices is key to the success of the website.
