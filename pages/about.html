                <h5> I am a UX designer who is currently pursuing my studies at Simon Fraser University
                    (SFU) in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology. My passion for design started at a
                    young age when I was fascinated with how products and services could be improved through
                    thoughtful design.
                    <br></br>
                    Born and raised in Vancouver, Canada, I had always been interested in technology and the way it
                    impacts people's lives. After completing high school, I decided to pursue my passion for design
                    by enrolling in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at SFU.
                    <br></br>

                    I have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I leverage these skills to bring my designs to life.

                    Outside of my studies, I enjoy attending design conferences and workshops to stay up-to-date
                    with the latest design trends and techniques. I am also an active member of the UX design
                    community in Vancouver and enjoy collaborating with other designers on various projects.
                    <br></br>

                    After graduating from SFU, I plan to pursue a career in UX design, where I hopes to continue
                    creating designs that improve people's lives.</h5>
