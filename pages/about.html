                <h5> I am a UX designer who is currently pursuing my studies at Simon Fraser University
                    (SFU) in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology. My passion for design started at a
                    young age when I was fascinated with how products and services could be improved through
                    thoughtful design.

                    Born and raised in Vancouver, Canada, I had always been interested in technology and the way it
                    impacts people's lives. After completing high school, I decided to pursue my passion for design
                    by enrolling in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at SFU.

                    During my time at SFU, I have honed my design skills by taking courses in user-centered design,
                    prototyping, and user research. I have also been involved in various design projects, including
                    designing a mobile app for a local business and creating a user-friendly website for a non-profit
                    organization.

                    I am passionate about creating designs that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also
                    functional and intuitive. I believe that design should be accessible to everyone and I work hard
                    to ensure that my designs are inclusive and user-friendly.

                    Outside of my studies, I enjoy attending design conferences and workshops to stay up-to-date
                    with the latest design trends and techniques. I am also an active member of the UX design
                    community in Vancouver and enjoy collaborating with other designers on various projects.

                    After graduating from SFU, I plan to pursue a career in UX design, where I hopes to continue
                    creating designs that improve people's lives.</h5>
